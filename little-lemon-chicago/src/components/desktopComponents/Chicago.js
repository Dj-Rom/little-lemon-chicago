                  Little Lemon began with a simple yet passionate idea: to bring a slice of warmth and a dash of zest to
                  the heart of Chicago. What started as a dream in a small kitchen quickly grew into a beloved spot for
                  locals and visitors alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our journey began when a group of friends, united by their love for fresh ingredients and vibrant
                  flavors, decided to turn their culinary dreams into reality. They envisioned a place where every meal
                  would be a celebration of flavor, community, and joy.
